# Hansel and Gretel: Module 4 Analysis Questions

## Question 1: Moral Pedagogy

**Question:** How does Hansel and Gretel use horror and violence as a way to teach a moral lesson rather than simply to scare the audience?

**Answer:** The violence isn't random—it's a teaching tool. The threat of being eaten is directly connected to the children eating the witch's house first. By linking what they consume to the danger of being consumed, the tale creates a visceral connection between bad behavior and consequences. It teaches moderation through fear in a way that sticks.

## Question 2: Social Fears

**Question:** In what ways can the witch in Hansel and Gretel be interpreted as a reflection of real social fears, such as hunger, poverty, and child abandonment, rather than only as a fantasy monster?

**Answer:** The witch embodies real anxieties about older women living alone, poverty, and survival during famine. She's historically coded with anti-Semitic stereotypes and the fear of the 'other.' She inverts the nurturing mother figure—instead of feeding children out of love, she fattens them up to eat them. Her gingerbread house is a trap disguised as comfort, reflecting fears about when help might actually be dangerous.

## Question 3: Family Dynamics

**Question:** How does the story of Hansel and Gretel challenge the idealized image of the family that is often presented in modern fairy-tale adaptations, such as Disney films?

**Answer:** Unlike Disney's sanitized versions, Hansel and Gretel shows that the real horror starts at home. The parents abandon their children to starve—that's the inciting incident, not some external evil. In earlier versions, it was their actual mother, not a stepmother, who suggests this. The story forces us to confront that sometimes the greatest danger comes from within the family, not from monsters in the forest.

## Question 4: Genre Connections

**Question:** How does Hansel and Gretel support the idea that fairy tales and horror are closely connected rather than separate genres?

**Answer:** This is basically a proto-horror story with all the elements: dark isolated setting, body horror (cannibalism), and Freud's 'Uncanny'—making the familiar terrifying. The gingerbread house is a death trap. Gretel becomes violent to survive, like the 'Final Girl' in slasher films. Fairy tales and horror are siblings—both deal with our deepest fears and use monsters to explore what terrifies us.

## Question 5: Gender Horror

**Question:** How might modern retellings of Hansel and Gretel, especially versions that focus more on Gretel's experience, reflect the idea of gender horror and changing cultural concerns?

**Answer:** Modern versions shift focus to Gretel's perspective. The witch becomes a symbol of female power that society fears. Contemporary retellings explore how Gretel must transform herself, sometimes violently, to survive. The horror becomes: what does it cost a young woman to claim her power? These adaptations tap into anxieties about female agency and the violent transformations women undergo to survive in a hostile world.
